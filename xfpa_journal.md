# XFPA Learning Journal

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Set up Python 3.13 and fixed PATH manually
- Created a project folder using CLI
- Learned what virtual environments (`venv`) are
- Activated the environment and installed LangChain, pandas, requests
- Built and ran my first Python script using FakeStore API

## 🧠 Key Concepts I Learned
- `python -m venv venv` → creates a virtual environment
- `requests.get(url)` → makes a GET request to an API
- `df.head()` → shows the first 5 rows of a DataFrame
- `print("\nSample Data")` → adds a blank line before output

## ❓ Questions I Asked Myself
- Why does PATH matter for Python versions?
- Why do we activate venv before installing packages?
- What does `\n` really do?
- Why can't CLI tools work like Excel?

## 💡 Lightbulb Moments
- PATH is just a search list of folders
- CLI tools need PATH because they run from *name*, not from icons
- I don’t want to code blindly — I want to understand every step
- Markdown is a clean way to track my learning

## 🏁 Next Steps
- Save API data into a SQL table
- Understand what each SQLAlchemy step does
- Build my own custom function to filter API data before storing
